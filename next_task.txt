The next task is to add option for EPSV input from user.
For now we should assume that only EPSV mode will be used(reject PASV, PORT and EPRT mode requests)

The proxy should send the client the 125 code and make a data connection with him on a random port. And also 
make a connection with the rest of the servers with EPSV mode.
Then raise a variable: EPSV_flag = true

RETR/LIST commands:
do the same thing as usual - broadcast them and send the response to the client.
If EPSV_flag=true:  send the file/list over the data connection and close it.
STOR command:
Same as for RETR/LIST but now read from the data connection and store it. After that, send the file to all servers.

DELE command:
as usual
