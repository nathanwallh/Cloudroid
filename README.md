# FTPnetwork
A solution for executing FTP commands over multiple servers in a network. It can be used by any regular FTP client.

Every server of the FTPnetwork consists of a FTP server and a Proxy server. FTP Clients should connect to the Proxy server.

The Proxy server is broadcasting FTP commands throught the network and making sure that they are executed currectly.
