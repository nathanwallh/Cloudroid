Cloudroid
=========
A basic cloud storage mechanism based on the FTP protocol, ideal for file sharing between multiple peers.
It consists of FTP servers connected together remotely, where each server has its own copy of shared directory with files.
FTP commands that are sent to one server, are broadcasted to every server on the network, so that the network operates as one unit.
