A cloud storage mechanism based on the FTP protocol.
It consists of FTP servers that are connected in a network, and can be accessed by clients anywhere.
The clients can send FTP commands to a single server, and those are executed simultaneously all over the network.
It also consists of a simple method for integrity check and update for unconsistent servers in the network.
