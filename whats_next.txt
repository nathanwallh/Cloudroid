Fork the server process into 2 processes:
1. "Front" server for communicating with the clients(recieving their FTP requests) and communicationg between other computers in the network.
2. "Background" FTP server with pyftpdlib for executing the client's requests.

For example:
Client asks for his remote directory list. The "Front" server recieves his request, and forwards it to all computers on network, then
combining the results and sending it back to the user.
