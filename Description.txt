Cloudroid - Cloud storage on a network of Odroid devices.

DESCRIPTION
A basic cloud storage mechanism based on the FTP protocol, ideal for file sharing between multiple peers.
It consists of FTP servers connected together remotely, where each server has it's own copy of shared files.
FTP commands that are sent to one server, are broadcasted to every other server on the network, so that 
the shared files remain consistent.


Code and Architecture 
The code is written in Python 3. For FTP server, we used the pyftpdlib library.
